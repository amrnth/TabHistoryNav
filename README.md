I often lose track of which tabs I opened before the current tab while navigating between tabs in a packed chrome window. To fix that, I created this extention which allows you to go back and forth in the history of your surfing journey. 

### Shortcuts(configurable in manifest.json):
| Action                | MacOS Shortcut | Others Shortcut |
|-----------------------|----------------|-----------------|
| Go back in history    | Ctrl+Z         | Alt+Z           |
| Go forward in history | Ctrl+Z         | Alt+Z           |

### Tasks:


- [x] Support back and forward actions
- [ ] Support navigation to previously closed tabs
- [ ] Support Edge, Safari, Firefox
- [ ] Publish to Chrome WebStore
